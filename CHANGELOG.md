## 3.2.0 (Comments are here to stay)

### New

- Runner: Default schema name can be set (PR #907)
- Stripping comments can be disabled (which will become the default in 4.x, Issue #956, PR #925)
- `WithGlobalConnectionString` accepting a lambda for lazy connection string query (PR #919)
- New Oracle 12c support
  - Identity generator options (PR #921)
	- Maximum name length increased to 128 (PR #940)
- Disable quoted names for PostgreSQL (Issue #958, PR #961)
	- Implemented by setting `PostgresOptions.ForceQuote` to `false`
	- Can be set with the provider option `Force Quote=false`
	- Default behaviour is `Force Quote=true`
- PostgreSQL: Added XML type (Issue #950, PR #995)
- Migration conditions (Issue #838, PR #990)
  - New attribute: `CurrentVersionMigrationConstraint` to ensure that this
	  migration only gets run when the database version is greater or equal
		than the given number. This allows some kind of migrations that will only
		be executed when a conversion is necessary.
- Allow loading of maintenances without tags (Issue #983, PR #984)
- SQL Server 2008: SPARSE column option (PR #946)
- `IConventionSet` loaded from given assemblies (Issue #916)

- [#890](https://github.com/fluentmigrator/fluentmigrator/issues/890): OracleManaged Migrations fail with runtime Exceptions

### Details

#### `dotnet-fm` now uses the Oracle beta ADO.NET driver

Oracle plans to release a non-beta version of the driver in Q3, but
it's the only Oracle driver that works under Linux/MacOS. The console
tool (`Migrate.exe`) is more Windows-centric and will therefore keep
using the standard Oracle ADO.NET library. The `dotnet-fm` is mostly
used on non-Windows platforms and is therefore predestinated to use
the new beta driver.

The statement from Oracle can be found on the
[Oracle website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/dotnet/tech-info/odpnet-dotnet-ef-core-sod-4395108.pdf).

The console tool will switch to the new driver when it becomes stable.

#### New configuration options

```c#
var services = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddFluentMigratorCore()
    .ConfigureRunner(rb => rb
        .AddSQLite()
        .ScanIn(typeof(YourType).Assembly));
        // There is a fluent interface to configure the targets for ScanIn
```

Configurations for `ScanIn(assemblies)`:

```text

```

Example:

```c#
var services = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddFluentMigratorCore()
    .ConfigureRunner(rb => rb
        .AddSQLite()
        .ScanIn(typeof(YourType).Assembly)
            .For.Migrations()
            .For.EmbeddedResources());
        // There is a fluent interface to configure the targets for ScanIn
```

#### Dependency injection changes (issue #877)

##### Supported scenario

This allows the reconfiguration of the connection string/used database at run-time.

##### Applies to

- Connection string
- Processor/generator selection
- Type filters

##### Changes

The following option classes are now resolved using `IOptionSnapshot<T>`:

- `ProcessorOptions`
- `SelectingProcessorAccessorOptions`
- `SelectingGeneratorAccessorOptions`
- `TypeFilterOptions`

The following services are now scoped instead of singleton:

- `IVersionTableMetaDataAccessor`
- `IVersionTableMetaData`
- `IMigrationSource`
- `IMigrationInformationLoader`

The `MigrationSource` now consumes all registered `IMigrationSourceItem` instances.

## 3.0.0

The new documentation is online on [https://fluentmigrator.github.io](https://fluentmigrator.github.io).

### Breaking changes

- [#850](https://github.com/fluentmigrator/fluentmigrator/issues/850): Set minimum .NET Framework version to 4.6.1. Older versions aren't supported anymore.
- `ProcessorOptions.Timeout` is now of type `System.TimeSpan?`
- `MigrationRunner.MaintenanceLoader` is now read-only
- `MigrationRunner.CaughtExceptions` returns now a `IReadOnlyList`
- `dotnet-fm` is now a global tool and requires at least the .NET Core tooling 2.1-preview2

### Added

- [#852](https://github.com/fluentmigrator/fluentmigrator/issues/852): Replace custom configuration mechanisms by using [Microsoft.Extensions.Options](https://github.com/aspnet/Options/)
- [#853](https://github.com/fluentmigrator/fluentmigrator/issues/853): Replace the announcer with [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging](https://github.com/aspnet/Logging/)
- Support for loading connection strings using a provided `IConfiguration` service ([Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration](https://github.com/aspnet/Configuration/))
- [#822](https://github.com/fluentmigrator/fluentmigrator/issues/822): `IMigrationExpressionValidator` for custom migration expression validation
- [#809](https://github.com/fluentmigrator/fluentmigrator/issues/809): Ability to add a schema owner during schema creation for SQL Server

### Fixed

- [#767](https://github.com/fluentmigrator/fluentmigrator/issues/767): Append `NULL` constraint for custom types for PostgreSQL and SQL Server

### Deprecated

- `IAssemblyCollection` and all its implementations
- `IAnnouncer` and all its implementations
- `IMigrationRunnerConventions.GetMigrationInfo`
- `IProfileLoader.ApplyProfiles()`
- `IProfileLoader.FindProfilesIn`
- `IMigrationProcessorOptions`
- `IMigrationProcessorFactory` and all its implementations
- `IRunnerContext` and `RunnerContext`, replaced by several dedicated options classes:
  - `RunnerOptions` are the new `RunnerContext` (minus some properties extracted into separate option classes)
  - `ProcessorOptions` for global processor-specific options
  - `GeneratorOptions` to allow setting the compatibility mode
  - `TypeFilterOptions` for filtering migrations by namespace
  - `AnnouncerOptions` to enable showing SQL statements and the elapsed time
  - `SelectingProcessorAccessorOptions` allows selection of a processor by its identifier
  - `SelectingGeneratorAccessorOptions` allows selection of a generator by its identifier
  - `AppConfigConnectionStringAccessorOptions` to allow leading the connection strings from the *.config xml file (deprecated, only for transition to `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`)
- `CompatabilityMode` (is now `ComatibilityMode`)
- `ApplicationContext` in various interfaces/classes
- `ManifestResourceNameWithAssembly` replaced by `ValueTuple`
- `MigrationGeneratorFactory`
- `MigrationProcessorFactoryProvider`
- `ITypeMap.GetTypeMap(DbType, int, int)`
- `IDbFactory`: Only the implementations will remain
- Several non-DI constructors

### Additional information

#### Connection string handling

The library assumes that in `ProcessorOptions.ConnectionString` is either a connection string or
a connection string identifier. This are the steps to load the real connection string.

- Queries all `IConnectionStringReader` implementations
  - When a connection string is returned by one of the readers, then this
    connection string will be used
  - When no connection string is returned, try reading from the next `IConnectionStringReader`
- When no reader returned a connection string, then return `ProcessorOptions.ConnectionString`

The connection string stored in `ProcessorOptions.ConnectionString` might be overridden
by registering the `IConnectionStringReader` instance `PassThroughConnectionStringReader`
as scoped service.

When no connection string could be found, the `SelectingProcessorAccessor` returns
a `ConnectionlessProcessor` instead of the previously selected processor.

#### Instantiating a migration runner

```c#
// Initialize the services
var serviceProvider = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddLogging(lb => lb.AddFluentMigratorConsole())
    .AddFluentMigratorCore()
    .ConfigureRunner(
        builder => builder
            .AddSQLite()
            .WithGlobalConnectionString(connectionString)
            .WithMigrationsIn(typeof(AddGTDTables).Assembly))
    .BuildServiceProvider();

// Instantiate the runner
var runner = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IMigrationRunner>();

// Run the migrations
runner.MigrateUp();
```

This adds the FluentMigrator services to the service collection and
configures the runner to use SQLite with the given connection string,
announcer and migration assembly.

Now you can instantiate the runner using the built service provider and use
its functions.
